# 2021-2022 Design Patterns
# Project 1-2-3
### Project Definition
Solve a software development problem using one (or possibly more) of the design patterns that we cover in class. **Your problem should be different from your previous projects.** 
You can do your project in groups of two. Specify your **group members** and **GitHub usernames** on the first page of the pdf file.
###  To-Do
- **Statement of Work**: Write your problem definition in detail using 100-200 words.
- **Design Patterns**: Select **at least two design patterns** that are useful in solving the problem you defined. Explain why and how you employ such design patterns in your Project.
 - **UML**: Draw a detailed class diagram of your proposed solution using some UML Diagram Drawing Tool.
 - **Research**: Find an implementation of a design pattern from a well known open source project. Explain the usage of the pattern in the project in detail. 
- **Implementation**:  Implement your proposed solution based on the UML Class Diagram using the base Maven Project that you are supplied. The Maven Project produces a executable **.jar** file typing following command: `mvn clean package`. To learn more about Maven Project, you can read maven in 5 minutes. (https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)
Your project should not expect any input from user, and it should produce decent outputs when run by the following command:  `java -jar target\project.jar`
You are allowed to change pom.xml to add or remove any dependency or plugin.
- You need to upload the **.pdf** file and necessary parts of your code. (Do not upload target folder and IDE-specific files)
- Please use the latest version of Java

###  To-Submit
Submit (1) Statement of Work, (2) Explanation on Utilized Design Patterns, (3) UML Class Diagram, and (4) Research. These written materials should be in a single **_.pdf_** file. Submit the .pdf file and (5) Implementation codes (**without the target folder and IDE-specific files**) to your github classroom repository
